About
=====
This project is a temporary stopgap for DevExpress's lack of support for complex summary calculations, seen here:

If DevExpress produces a solution in the future that covers all use cases, this solution is deprecated.

Getting Started
===============
ModdedEndUserDesigner.cs shows how to use the feature.
If you build this project and reference it in your software, you can drag ModdedEndUserDesigner from the toolbox instead of XRDesignMdiController.
Or you can call SummaryFieldsFeature.Apply directly, if that is easier.

This will give you a new menu option in your end user designer fields list in window.
Right click and select Add Summary Field (directly under Add Calculated Field).



Documentation
=============
A summary field *is* a calculated field. You can use a summary field's value in another calculated field's expression or another summary field's expression.

Whereas a regular calculated field operates only on the current row, the summary field can operate in one of two modes:

 1) Immediate mode, in which it calculates a summary on all rows in the data table (with an optional filter).
    The summary value remains the same for each row in the data table. Each data row is considered, whether printed on the report or not.
    This mode is most useful when used as part of a bigger calculation.
    For example, add a summary field named "SalesTotal" with the expression "[Sales]" and summary function Sum.
    Then add a second field, a normal per-row calculated field named "PercentOfTotal", with the expression "[Sales] * 100 / [SalesTotal]".

 2) Incremental mode, in which it calculates a summary from the top row of the table to the current row.
    Useful for running totals. Also can reset the summary at any group band (Running property), not just the immediate parent group.
    Reset can even be disabled so that it continues accumulating to the end of the report.

There is no limit to the amount of chaining that can be done between summary fields and calculated fields.
Summary fields can summarize other summary fields, other calculated fields, data fields from the current table, or any valid expression combining ay of these.

You are limited only by your imagination.



Support
=======
This project is taken from code that has been in production for over a year with minor tweaks along the way.
I wouldn't release it if it wasn't reliable; however it's possible that I overlooked a use case, so verify your reports carefully.

If you find a bug, please report it through the github issue tracker.
You are at the mercy of my free time and your ingenuity. That said, if you upload a runnable demo demonstrating the bug I will likely have it fixed in a day or two.

If you are confused about how the feature works, I'm happy to get back to you as well. I'll update the documentation as needed.
